# Trigger the workflow on manual dispatch and when merging a PR.
# If doccmd's version has not changed, the tagging will fail.
# If doccmd's version has changed, the tagging will succeed and a new release will
# be created.
# This means that the version can stay in sync, and if the hook needs to be updated
# to a new version to release changes in this repository, a new release of doccmd is needed.
